                            <p><small>The current automotive market offers a very wide variety of vehicles for just about any taste, any necessity, and any budget. Whether you're looking for a small, frugal commuter, a reliable family hauler, a hard-working truck, an exciting performance car, a fancy luxury car, or anything in-between, you're sure to find something that's just right for you on the new car market and Autotrader is the perfect place to find it. </small></p>
                            <p class="mb-6"><small><strong>Pros:</strong> Perhaps the most obvious pro of buying a new car is that you are the first owner. Buying new ensures you'll get the most possible life out of the car since it has almost no miles on it when you start driving it. Even the cleanest used cars can't be in as good of condition as a new car. If you're planning on keeping the car long-term, you can get a lot of years and a lot of miles out of your new car. New cars have excellent warranties that can give you peace of mind. Having your maintenance covered for a certain period ensures that you won't have to worry about maintenance for a while and by the time your warranty expires, you might want to trade-in for another car anyway. </small></p>
